Complete Project Workflow
1. Initial Website Load
The user visits the DeFi Therapist website
The dark mode interface presents a clean layout with the main sections:
Header with the DeFi Therapist branding
Hero section explaining the application's purpose
Connect & Analyze section (prominently displayed)
Results section (initially hidden until analysis is performed)
2. Connecting a Wallet
User clicks the "Connect Phantom Wallet" button
The Phantom wallet browser extension opens a connection prompt
User approves the connection in their Phantom wallet
The wallet's public address and SOL balance appear in the wallet info section
A success message confirms the successful connection
3. Loading Trading Data
Once connected, the application automatically fetches the user's recent trading history from the OKX DEX API
Trading data includes:
Trading pairs (e.g., SOL/USDC, BTC/USDC)
Buy and sell prices
Trade amounts
Profit/loss calculations
Timestamps
A "Trades Loaded" notification shows the number of trades retrieved
4. Analyzing Trading Behavior
User clicks the "Get Trade Therapy Analysis" button
A loading indicator shows that analysis is in progress
Behind the scenes:
The application sends the wallet address and trade data to the server
Server formats the trade data and sends it to OpenAI's GPT-4o API
OpenAI analyzes the trading patterns, psychological factors, and behaviors
The AI generates a comprehensive analysis in JSON format
The server stores this analysis in the database and returns it to the client
5. Viewing Analysis Results
The Results Section displays the AI's analysis with:
A summary of overall trading activity
Detailed trading psychology analysis
Specific actionable recommendations
Identified strengths (highlighted in green)
Areas for improvement (highlighted in red)
All text is clearly visible with proper contrast in dark mode
6. Additional Actions
User can disconnect their wallet if desired
User can request a new analysis after making more trades
Previous analyses are stored and can be retrieved for the same wallet address
7. Technical Flow
Frontend: React components handle UI states and API requests
Backend: Express server processes analysis requests
Database: Stores wallet addresses and analysis results
APIs:
Phantom Wallet API for wallet connection
OKX DEX API for trade data
OpenAI API for intelligent analysis
This creates a seamless experience where users can connect their Solana wallet, have their trading data analyzed by AI, and receive personalized insights to improve their trading psychology and strategies.
